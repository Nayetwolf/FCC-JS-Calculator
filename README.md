# Objective:

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX.

We can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. also we should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks.
### Note On Calculator Logic:

 It should be noted that there are two main schools of thought on calculator input logic: immediate execution logic and formula logic. Our example utilizes formula logic and observes order of operation precedence, immediate execution does not. Either is acceptable, but please note that depending on which you choose, your calculator may yield different results than ours for certain equations (see below example). As long as your math can be verified by another production calculator, please do not consider this a bug.

### EXAMPLE: 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 =

    Immediate Execution Logic: 11.5
    Formula/Expression Logic: 32.5
